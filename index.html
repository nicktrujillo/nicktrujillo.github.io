      <p>
        I'm a DevOps consultant who specializes in Copado implementations, with a particular focus on their new AI Platform. Over the past 3years, I've helped organizations streamline their development processes by combining traditional DevOps practices with AI-enhanced solutions.
        <br>
        My background in software development gives me a unique perspective when working with clients. I understand both the technical challenges developers face and the bigger picture of what organizations need to deliver quality software efficiently. Whether it's setting up CICD pipelines, training teams on best practices, or helping clients leverage AI to optimize their workflows, I'm passionate about finding solutions that actually work in the real world.
