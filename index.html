        <p>
            I'm a DevOps consultant who specializes in Copado implementations, with a particular focus on their new AI Platform. Over the past two years, I've helped organizations streamline their development processes by combining traditional DevOps practices with AI-enhanced solutions. What really drives me is finding that sweet spot between technical excellence and practical implementation - taking complex systems and making them work seamlessly for development teams.

            My background in software development gives me a unique perspective when working with clients. I understand both the technical challenges developers face and the bigger picture of what organizations need to deliver quality software efficiently. Whether it's setting up CI/CD pipelines, training teams on best practices, or helping clients leverage AI to optimize their workflows, I'm passionate about finding solutions that actually work in the real world.
